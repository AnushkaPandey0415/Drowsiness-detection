# Driver-Drowsiness-Detector
This is a project by me and my team. 
Drowsiness poses a significant risk in scenarios where attentiveness is crucial, such as driving. Our project addresses this concern by employing computer vision techniques to monitor facial features, particularly eye movements, and detect signs of drowsiness in real-time. The use of OpenCV, Dlib, and NumPy ensures efficient image processing, face detection, and landmark prediction, forming the foundation of our drowsiness detection system.
